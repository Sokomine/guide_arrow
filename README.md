Mod for Minetest that adds a guide which will lead you to specified coordinates

Not finished yet! Coordinates are hardcoded so far. May not work relieably.

To invoke the guide, type /guide in the chat. It looks like a MESE-node streched in hight.
If the distance between the guide and you grows too big, the guide will "beam" back to you.
